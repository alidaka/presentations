## Ijeoma Oluo

<p class="fragment fade-out">_So You Want to Talk about Race_</p>
<p class="fragment fade-in">Beyond Hearts and Minds</p>

---

> There's a difference between work you enjoy and work you find rewarding.

> There's no amount of hearts and minds we can take to the bank.

> System oppression only requires you do nothing.

Think of racism not as a disease of hearts

Think of racism as a function of systems.

Note: "Kid in a candy store" getting maced

Three books:

When you see systems of inequity:

**AFFIRM** the humanity of the victim

**REPORT** to police, Twitter, ...

**CONFRONT** the abuser
